# Quick Fix for Vercel Deployment

## ✅ Changes Made

I've fixed the "Invalid Version" error by:

1. ✅ Added `engines` field to `package.json` (specifies Node.js 18.17+)
2. ✅ Created `.nvmrc` file (tells Vercel to use Node 18.17.0)
3. ✅ Simplified `vercel.json` configuration

## 🚀 Deploy These Changes

### Step 1: Commit the fixes
```bash
cd C:\Users\Ola-Adesanya\CascadeProjects\whytee-stitches
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Add Node.js version specification for Vercel deployment"
```

### Step 2: Push to GitHub
```bash
git push origin main
```

### Step 3: Vercel will auto-deploy
- Vercel detects the new commit
- Automatically rebuilds with correct Node version
- Your site goes live! 🎉

## 📝 What Was Wrong?

The error occurred because:
- Vercel didn't know which Node.js version to use
- Without explicit version specification, it may have used an incompatible version
- The `engines` field in package.json tells Vercel: "Use Node 18.17 or higher"

## 🔍 Verify It Works

After pushing, check:
1. Vercel dashboard shows new deployment
2. Build logs show: "Using Node.js 18.x"
3. Build completes successfully
4. Site is live at your Vercel URL

If you still get errors, check:
- All files are committed and pushed
- GitHub repo is up to date
- Vercel project is connected to correct repo/branch
